# WEEK-3 Completed!!
This week I learnt about how to send ray into scene, sphere etc. I learnt how to compile the C++ program
on gpu by sycl. This week was long and interesting to learn more, awaiting foe next week. This week was the most interesting
as we done more materials into the scene.

# CPU-Part
This folder contains files that run the program without sycl and gpu. I have done ray tracking weekend upto 11th chapter.

# SYCL-Part
This folder contains files for compilation on gpu by sycl. I have added the scene of rays in different 
materials like dielectric,metal and lambertian..
