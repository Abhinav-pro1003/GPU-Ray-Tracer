âœ… Week 1: Vec3, Makefiles & Math Foundations

Week1 all 4 goals Completed!!!

It was excited to learn more concepts new to me in C++ and even in physics.
I guess test executable given is wrong in refraction case as the Dr's of refracted ray changes even if the refractive index is 1.

In most of the case I checked it gives a refracted ray parallel to normal.
