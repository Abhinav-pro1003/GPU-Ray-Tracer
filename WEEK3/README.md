# WEEK-3 Completed!!
This week I learnt about how to send ray into scene, sphere etc. I learnt how to compile the C++ program
on gpu by sycl. This week was long and interesting to learn more, awaiting foe next week.

# Part-1
This folder contains files that run the program without sycl and gpu.

# Part-3
This folder contains files for compilation on gpu by sycl. The header render_kernel is the new one which 
contains class render, render_kernel and their related functions. If you are interested to compile the
program main.cpp read Part-3 README.md before.
