# This folder contains the final Image traced by my Ray Tracer !!
Here the folders CPU-Part and GPU-Part contains the respective code to get the final image via CPU 
and GPU respectively. This was the craziest and amazing week of all :)

# Difference in CPU and GPU part
The compilation time in cpu is higher than gpu. 

Gpu gives the image more shaper than cpu.

Writing and fixing bugs is easy with cpu.

Cpu part can show how many lines scanned and remaining but in gpu we could not print as they run in parallel.
