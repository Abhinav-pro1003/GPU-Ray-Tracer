# Final image traced by GPU!!
Here this folder contains code to get the final image by gpu. The compilation time here was
less compared to cpu as it is about ~2hrs. This is because I run the SYCL code in cpu, as my pc can't
support running on gpu orelse it would have been more faster.

# Final Image
final_image_1.ppm is the file where I used xorand() function to get the random number between 0 and 1. This image
is so sharp and clear with no black spots.

final_image_2.ppm is the file where I used randf() function to get the random number between 0 and 1. This
image have black spots dispersed near the shadow.
